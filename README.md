## 🚀 Overview

This project turns plain English queries like:

> "Show roads within 500m of PGIMER hospital"

...into **geospatial workflows and visualizations** using a Large Language Model (LLM) and tools like `GeoPandas`, `Folium`, and `OpenStreetMap`.

The system reasons through each query step-by-step — geocoding, filtering, buffering, masking — to generate accurate maps.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Uses **GPT-4 (via LangChain)** for spatial query reasoning  
- 🗺️ Loads and filters **OpenStreetMap road data** using OSMnx  
- 📐 Performs spatial operations like **buffering**, **intersection**, and **masking**  
- 🧪 Visualizes results using **Folium interactive maps**  
- 🧵 Includes **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** explanation for every query

## 📍 Sample Queries

| Prompt | Operation |
|--------|-----------|
| 🟢 Roads within 500m of city center | Buffer + Intersect |
| 🟣 Major roads only | Filter by OSM tags |
| 🟡 Roads near PGIMER | Geocode + Buffer |
| 🟠 Roads in north Chandigarh | Region clip |
| 🔴 Roads far from flood zones | Exclude masked area |

All results are interactive and rendered directly in the notebook.

## 🧪 Reasoning Approach

Each query is handled in steps:
1. Parse intent using LLM (e.g., "near", "within", "exclude")
2. Geocode key locations
3. Generate spatial buffers or masks
4. Filter roads or features based on logic
5. Render results with map overlays

## 🌱 Future Scope

- Integrate real flood zone datasets (e.g., IMD shapefiles)  
- Add satellite overlays (Sentinel/Landsat)  
- Accept voice queries  
- Deploy as Gradio app or web API
